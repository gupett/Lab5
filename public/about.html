        <h3>Asian Stocks Mixed On Hawkish Fed Minutes, Stronger US Dollar</h3> The Nikkei 225 ended down 1.1% with South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also down, if not by much. The Shanghai Composite was higher into its close, having just reopened after the long Chinese Lunar New Year break. The ASX 200 is Sydney
        was up by 0.1% after a choppy session. The US Dollar started the session trading broadly higher as investors took in the Fed minutes, however it failed to hold its gains against some currencies through the Asians session and DailyFX Chief Currency
        Strategist John Kicklighter wonders whether there’s really enough risk appetite ‘fuel’ for a real Dollar turnaround. Gold prices slipped as they often do when the prospect of higher US interest rates is front and centre. Higher Treasury yields
        generally take a toll on appetite for the non-yielding metal. Oil prices were down too on that firmer greenback. There are plenty of economic data releases still to come Thursday. Germany’s Ifo Business survey is first up, followed by official
        Gross Domestic Product numbers out of the UK. The European Central Bank will publish its account of the last monetary policy meeting too. From the other side of the Atlantic will come US jobless-claim figures and the Canadian retail sales release.

        <h3>USD/CHF Rallies to Resistance: Will Sellers Respond?</h3> The US Dollar extended its down-trend last week, extending the year-plus bearish trend in the Greenback. After the Dollar came into 2017 flying high on the back of the ‘Trump Trade’ or the ‘reflation trade’, gravity has set in and the Dollar
        has given back all of the post-election gains and then some. This theme has also happened as economic prospects have brightened throughout Europe, leading to some spectacular gains in EUR/USD over the past year. More recently, those gains have
        started to congest as EUR/USD began to test the 1.2500 psychological level; but all the while this has been going on, an arguably smoother trend has started to show in USD/CHF.
